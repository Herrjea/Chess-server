# Chess-server

Class project made by José María Gómez García and Manuel Herrera Ojea.


TCP concurrent server that allows pairs of players to play the chess game as it is implemented [here](https://github.com/Herrjea/Regular-chess).

Current version only allows players to be in independent terminals under the same localhost. But it's being fun to make!
